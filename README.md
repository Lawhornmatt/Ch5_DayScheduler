This is the README.md for the Challenge Five "Work Day Scheduler" for the UT Coding Bootcamp.

## CRITERIA: 

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

I plan on the following options:

* This is basically a glorified list.
